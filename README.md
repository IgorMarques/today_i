# Daily App

This app is is a simple to do list intended to help people who have daily meetings.

You can create and toggle tasks that you are working or plan to work on soon.

**Big disclaimer: this current version is only an exercise for me to learn and improve my Javascript skills. Take it easy when judging my code ðŸ˜…**

## Intro

This app has two major components:
- A frontend in pure HTML/CSS/Javascript
- A [backend app](https://github.com/IgorMarques/today_i_backend) in Ruby on Rails

This repo is from the front-end only. Check the backend app [here](https://github.com/IgorMarques/today_i_backend)

Just run the backend app first (see instructions on the backend app)
and then open the this app by opening `index.html` in your browser.

```shell
$ open index.html
```

## Lint the code
